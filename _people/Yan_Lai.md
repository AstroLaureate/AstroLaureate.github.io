# Biography 
I was an Honours student supervised by Cullan and Tamara at The University of Queensland. My Honours project focused on whether combining the position and velocity measurements of galaxies together can reduce the cosmic variance (an effect introduced by the inhomogeneity in the local universe). I finished my Honours project in November 2020 and started my Ph.D. project in July 2021. I have been working on a new method to better constrain the growth rate of structure in the universe which will help us to potentially determine the correct model of gravity. Additionally, I am also looking at compressing the covariance matrix and data vector in future surveys such as DESI to reduce the computational time. 

**Research interests**: The peculiar velocity of galaxies, the growth rate of large-scale structures in the universe, compressing data in future surveys and the wide-angle effect on peculiar velocity surveys.
