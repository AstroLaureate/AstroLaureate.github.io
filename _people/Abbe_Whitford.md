# Biography
I started honours in Feb 2020 and I am expecting to submit my thesis at the end of this semester.

**Research interests**: 
 
I graduated from Griffith University with a BSc (majoring in physics and mathematics) in 2019. I started honours in 2020 at UQ to pursue my interest in astrophysics and cosmology. My honours project is supervised by Dr Cullan Howlett and Professor Tamara Davis.
 
My project I am working on can be summarised as:
 
Attempting to forecast the ability of future peculiar velocity surveys to put a constraint on the masses of neutrinos.
