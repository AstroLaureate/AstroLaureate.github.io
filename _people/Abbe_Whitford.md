# Biography
I completed honours in astrophysics at UQ in 2021 and I am hoping to commence a PhD in Astrophysics at UQ in 2022.

**Research interests**: 
 
I graduated from Griffith University with a BSc (majoring in physics and mathematics) in 2019. I completed honours in 2021 at University of Queensland to pursue my interest in astrophysics and cosmology. My honours project was supervised by Dr Cullan Howlett and Professor Tamara Davis
 
My project can be summarised as:
Attempting to forecast the ability of future peculiar velocity surveys to put a constraint on the masses of neutrinos.
