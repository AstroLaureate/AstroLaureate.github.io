# Biography
I graduated from Griffith University with a BSc (majoring in physics and mathematics) in 2019, and a BSc honours Class I (physics) in 2021 at University of Queensland. My honours project was supervised by Dr Cullan Howlett (UQ) and Professor Tamara Davis (UQ). For this project I produced theoretical forecasts for the ability of various upcoming galaxy surveys that will measure redshifts and peculiar motions to constrain the masses of neutrinos. 

**Research interests**:
Particle cosmology, neutrinos, Large Scale Structure (LSS) of the universe, galaxy peculiar motions, theoretical and observational cosmology.
The aim of my PhD project will be to produce neutrino mass constraints with real data collected by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI).
