# Biography
I started my PhD on October 2020, expanding on my Honours project on gravitational waves (GW). My PhD project title is "Investigating Gravitational Wave Cosmology with Simulated Data", and I am supervised by Dr Cullan Howlett and Professor Tamara Davis. Currently, I am working on modelling binary black hole merger rates as a function of galaxy properties, using a galaxy formation and evolution model (SHARK) and a population synthesis tool (COMPAS). This is essential for future GW follow-ups, since it enables galaxy redshift surveys to target galaxies that are likely to emit GWs. In future work, I can use my simulated GWs as probes for cosmology and large-scale structures, by applying new techniques such as the 'Dark Siren' method. 

**Research interests**: Gravitational wave astronomy, semi-analytic modelling of galaxy formation and evolution, and stellar population models.
