# Researcher biography

I am a Cosmologist studying the properties of the Universe on the largest scales, actively participating in the  key large survey projects that will shed light on the unsolved questions of Cosmology. By mapping the positions of millions of galaxies, I investigate the unknown physics of the dark energy which drives the evolution of the Universe today, and the physics just after the Big Bang, when the ripples which grew under gravity to become galaxies were created.

I am a member of the two key experiments designed to understand dark energy and gravity, the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). I am also a member of the Taipan Galaxy Survey. I am lead of the DESI sub-working group: C3-cosmology analysis framework.
Between 2014 and 2020 I was also member of:

• The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).  
• European Space Agency (ESA) and the Euclid Consortium.
