# Researcher biography

 _I am a Cosmologist studying the properties of the Universe on the largest scales..._
 
By mapping the positions of millions of galaxies, I investigate the unknown physics of the dark energy which drives the evolution of the Universe today, and the physics just after the Big Bang, when the ripples which grew under gravity to become galaxies were created.

<!-- 
I am a Cosmologist studying the properties of the Universe on the largest scales, actively participating in the  key large survey projects that will shed light on the unsolved questions of Cosmology. By mapping the positions of millions of galaxies, I investigate the unknown physics of the dark energy which drives the evolution of the Universe today, and the physics just after the Big Bang, when the ripples which grew under gravity to become galaxies were created.
 -->
<!-- I am a member of the two key experiments designed to understand dark energy and gravity, the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). I am also a member of the Taipan Galaxy Survey. I am lead of the DESI sub-working group: C3-cosmology analysis framework.
Between 2014 and 2020 I was also member of:

• The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).  
• European Space Agency (ESA) and the Euclid Consortium.   -->

I am actively participating in the key experiments designed to understand dark energy and gravity. I am co-chair of the <a href="https://www.desi.lbl.gov/"> Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument</a> (DESI) lensing working group, and a active member of the <a href="https://www.lsst.org/"> Vera Rubin Observatory</a> (LSST) and the <a href="https://www.darkenergysurvey.org/"> Dark Energy Survey (DES)</a>. In the past I had lead science with the  <a href="https://classic.sdss.org/">Sloan Digital Sky Survey</a>,  one of the major quests of contemporary physics that has spurred advancement in answering a range of fundamental questions about the origins of the universe
	          
I am passionate about communicating top-level research ideas to audiences outside our immediate academic sub-community. I have experience on a variety of media, including radio, public talks and lectures to local schools, science festivals and amateur astronomy groups, outreach activities at <a href="http://www.icg.port.ac.uk/stargazing/">Stargazing Live events</a>, as well as through written pieces.  

 I am an advocate for making STEM field accessible to everyone.  During my career, I took part into different initiatives aiming to reduce structural barriers faced by different minorities in academia and inspire the next generation of STEM careers. I am part of the <a href="https://www.uqu.com.au/club/women-in-science-association"> Women in Science Association</a> with the aim to foster a community for young women in STEM, within and beyond the academic community. I worked and volunteered at N.G.O. centres, in Italy and Australia supporting young students to overcome educational inequality caused by poverty and other conditions.

 Since 2021 I am on the <a href="https://asa-ecr.org/">Early Career Chapter </a> committee for the <a href="https://asa.astronomy.org.au/"> Astronomical Society of Australia </a> (ASA) to promote and assist the career development of early and mid-career researchers in the Australian astronomy community. I am also part of the <a href="https://staff.uq.edu.au/information-and-services/health-safety-wellbeing/personal/wellness">Wellbeing ambassador program </a> at University of Queensland, to promote and assist the career development of early and mid-career researchers in the Australian astronomy community.
