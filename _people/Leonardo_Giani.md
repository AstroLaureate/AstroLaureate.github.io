# Researcher biography

I am a theoretical physicist and my research focuses on the marvellous riddle of the accelerated expansion of the Universe, 
which demands some source of repulsive gravity to be explained, usually referred to as Dark Energy. 

The most appealing candidate of Dark Energy is a cosmological constant, and together with Cold Dark Matter they constitute the pillars of the standard cosmological model, grounded on Einstein's general relativity.

My research focuses on those theoretically well motivated alternatives to the standard model paradigm that can take its issues 
and  tensions  while  producing  a  viable  cosmological  history, with  particular  attention  to alternative Dark Energy (DE) scenarios and to innovative tests of gravity.
 
Currently, I am working on cosmological tests suitable for theories violating the Equivalence Principle through a space-time dependence of the fundamental constants, like the Newton and fine structure constants.

I am also very interested in the recently established tension on the value of some cosmological parameters inferred through early and late time Universe observations, and whether it is possible to solve this issue within alternative models of gravity or structure formations.
 
On a personal level, I am mostly concerned about Environmental issues and I really enjoy spending my free time in outdoor activities or playing chess and music, although without trace of any notable achievement.
