# Biography
I am a 3rd year PhD student, working out of the School of Mathematics and Physics under the supervision of Dr Cullan Howlett and Prof. Tamara Davis. My primary interest is in better understanding the history of the universe, its present make-up, and by extension, its fate. As part of my work, I use snapshots of the universe (made up of millions of galaxy positions) to measure cosmic structure at the largest scales. Using state-of-the-art computing resources and techniques, we compare these snapshots to different models of how our universe may have evolved. The answers from this analysis, as part of the bigger picture in cosmology, shed light on topics like the expansion of the universe, and the properties of dark energy.  
 
I am a member of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), a monumental new survey which aims to provide one of the clearest snapshots of our universe to date, using 40 million galaxy positions. 

**Research interests**: exploring the effects of redshift errors on cosmological
constraints, BAO cosmology and the General relativistic description of
    expanding space
